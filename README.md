Creating my info/resume website from html5up.net template.

Since I left real estate and begain transitioning to the tech field, I had been procrastinating on directing my domain to a website. Sure, I took the harder way and got into the code of a template to personalize the site. I could have done drag and drop with Wordpress. But I had done that over 10 years ago. I wanted to challenge myself a bit more.

Take a look and feel free to give suggestions. Honestly, I'm not a fan of the color scheme. But it took me 2 solid days just to do these little edits and I got tired of trying to read through 2000 lines of CSS code to find the colors I wanted to change.

The DOM came in handy using Inspect in Chrome to find the pieces I was trying to modify. Perfection inhibits completion so here it is: eboniallen.com. I'm sure I'll edit this 100 more times in the next few months.
